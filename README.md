# highschool-java-cs3
These projects are from my senior year of highschool, they consist of many problems that were given to me by my teacher. The teacher often supplied only the starter code and the test cases for us. We were expected to supply the main. I have a strong understanding of all the coede in the projects, and a decent understanding of most of the starter code.
